## Chalenges i faced:
1. API is not REST compatible... Geting data with POST is something ew for me.
2. Somteimes API requires id, and in some cases team_id. That took me some time to figure this out.
3. API route /teams/games/new always returns 404 whatewher i do...

## What else whould i do if this was Prod level application:

* Enable TS support
* Split components even more
* Enbled RXJS to support complex async calls
